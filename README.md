# AUTOMATE COMMERCE

## Requirements
1. You must have docker desktop, or docker and docker-compose
2. Node Js and NPM

## Getting Started
1. create a .env.development file
1. Run `docker-compose up` from the root of the project to create a local postgres database and object storage.
2. Open a new terminal window and Run `npm install && npx prisma generate` to install dependencies and generate the prisma client
3. Run `npx prisma db push && npx prisma db seed` to create tables and seed the development db
4. Run `npm run dev` to run the development server.

## Seeding the database
- to seed the database you can run `npx prisma db seed`. this command will clear and re-seed the DB
- after running the seed command you must clear http cookies as well as local storage to remove any old leads / carts
- clear http cookies by navigating or making a request to the following url `http://localhost:3000/api/cookies/clear`
- clear the local sotrage by opening up your browser console and running `localStorage.clear()`

## Searching
make sure you have the pg_trgm extension enabled in your postgres database. To do this you can run the following:
1. to enter psql shell `psql -h localhost -p 5432 -U postgres -d ergonomica`
2. search for the pg_trgm extension `SELECT * FROM pg_extension WHERE extname = 'pg_trgm';` this should display atleast 1 row
3. if no extension is found run `CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS pg_trgm;`
4. run `exit` to exit psql shell

## Testing
End to end tests are held in the `cypress/e2e/` directory.

You can run the test suite without having to install any depencies manually by running `./test.sh`.

If you want to run tests manually you can run `npx cypress open` while having another terminal running the dev server. Beware that performance tests will fail when running the test suite with the dev server; If you want to test performance run `npm run build && npm run start` to build and serve the app.


# Analytics
to use analytics you must set the following env variables. The analytics package has modules for the following analytics providers:
- Posthog (opensource analytics)
- Meta (pixel & conversion API)
- Google Analytics
- X analytics

The analytics package is built in a way where the main methods exported will trigger events in all of the selected providers; for example if google analytics, posthog and meta are selected; a pageview event will trigger a pagheview in all of these platfoirms simultaneously. This makes it very easy to add new providers without having to go to different places in the code.

To get started you must set the follwoing environment variables:

```
# toggle usage of analytics
NEXT_PUBLIC_USE_ANALYTICS

# post hog
NEXT_PUBLIC_POSTHOG_HOST
NEXT_PUBLIC_POSTHOG_KEY

# google analytics
NEXT_PUBLIC_GA_TRACKING_ID

# metap pixel
NEXT_PUBLIC_FB_PIXEL_ID

# twitter
NEXT_PUBLIC_TWITTER_BEARER_TOKEN
```

## Setting up posthog

## Setting up Googl Analytics (GA4)

## Setting up Meta

### Pixel
1. create a new pixel
2. add the id of the new meta pixel in your env viariable
3. Now you can monitor your pixels activity by accesing this URL business.facebook.com/events_manager2/list/dataset/<FB_PIXEL_ID> . All the activities carried out in the website should register in this page in the ovberviw. beware there is a 30 minute lag for events to register

### Conversion API
1. in the previous URL click on the Test Events tab
2. click on the tab that says `Confirm your serverâ€™s events are set up correctly`
3. click on the Graph API Explorer button
4. lets make a GET request to `/me?fields=id,name`
