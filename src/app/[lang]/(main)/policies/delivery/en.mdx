These Policies are valid for the website [ergonomicadesk.com](https://ergonomicadesk.com/) and it is understood that upon purchasing any of our products or services, the customer accepts the terms, conditions, and delivery policies specified below.

**1. RECEIPT OF GOODS**

It is essential that at the time of receiving the goods, any incident regarding the condition of the goods or the packaging is indicated on the delivery note signed with the carrier and communicated to **Ergonomica Desk** via email at [ventas@ergonomicadesk.com](mailto:ventas@ergonomicadesk.com) within a maximum of 6 hours from the receipt of the package. If the package shows significant damage that suggests the product might be damaged, it should be rejected, and Ergonomica Desk should be notified immediately.

**2. RETURN OF GOODS**

The customer will have a period of 6 hours from the receipt of the product to send any claims related to the supplied product to Ergonomica Desk. After this period, the products will be considered as accepted by the customer. The claim should be made through the online form available on [ergonomicadesk.com](https://ergonomicadesk.com/) or via email to [ventas@ergonomicadesk.com](mailto:ventas@ergonomicadesk.com). Ergonomica Desk is not responsible for and reserves the right to reject returns in case of merchandise in poor condition due to misuse or transportation damage. If a return is rejected due to misuse, the customer must bear the transportation costs for the return.

Returns will only be accepted in the following cases:

1. The return of non-defective merchandise is generally NOT ACCEPTED. In special cases as an exception, the return is accepted but always with prior approval from Ergonomica Desk, assigning a "CASE" number that must be included at the time of return. In these cases, a 5% management and administration fee will be applied to the value of the merchandise. Returns for amounts less than $350 are not accepted.
2. Defective material at the time of receipt: If the material is defective, a return request must be made on our website. Once a "CASE" number is assigned, the product will be sent to Ergonomica Desk with its original packaging, manuals, and accessories, and with the corresponding "CASE" number visible on the outside of the packaging.
3. Defective material within the warranty period: In the case of defective material within the warranty period, the warranty will be processed. The original packaging, manuals, or accessories will NOT be necessary. Once a "CASE" number is assigned, the product will be sent to Ergonomica Desk within a maximum period of 72 hours. The "CASE" number must be visible on the outside of the packaging. After 72 hours, the "CASE" will be canceled.

**3. WARRANTY**

The warranty for all our products will be established by Ergonomica Desk on the website [ergonomicadesk.com](https://ergonomicadesk.com/) and may vary depending on the type of product.

**4. CONFIDENTIALITY**

Ergonomica Desk guarantees the security of its customers' information, which is encrypted to our secure site and handled in such a way that it cannot be deciphered by external agents.

**5. AVAILABILITY AND PRICES**

Prices are expressed in US Dollars, according to the reference exchange rate on the day of the transaction. They may also be subject to change without prior notice.

In special cases, as an exception, deliveries/pickups outside operating hours will be accepted but always with prior approval from Ergonomica Desk.

The customer agrees that if their purchase order is registered outside the operating hours for receiving purchases, it will be shipped in the next available time slot.

**IMPORTANT**: Purchase orders made online on Sunday will be processed the next working day.

**7. PAYMENTS**

The customer agrees to pay/settle/cancel the purchase order made through the portal [ergonomicadesk.com](https://ergonomicadesk.com/) in full.

The payment method is by Visa or Mastercard credit card. Ergonomica Desk is affiliated with Verified by Visa and Master Security Code services to offer its customers the highest possible security and confidence when making online payments.

**8. ORDER POLICIES**

The customer must provide complete recipient address details. If the customer does not have the complete address, they may be assisted in finding it, as long as it is a business, company, or place of public interest due to its commercial, service, or governmental nature, in which case the customer must provide at least the phone number, email, and name of the contact person. Ergonomica Desk reserves the right not to provide information to the customer if they have provided partial or misleading information about their identity.

**9. DELIVERY POLICIES**

Ergonomica Desk delivers in Panama City and its surroundings. Deliveries to other provinces will be sent with a freight service available in that province. The customer is responsible for providing the necessary information about the recipient to make the requested product delivery. Any error or lack of information in this regard will be entirely the customer's responsibility.

The estimated delivery time is 1-5 days depending on the delivery location. Deliveries to other provinces will additionally be subject to the delivery times of the freight company.

**10. CANCELLATIONS**

Once the Purchase Order has been sent and processed through our portal, [ergonomicadesk.com](https://ergonomicadesk.com/), cancellations of any purchase order will be accepted within 24 hours of the payment of said order, as long as it has not been invoiced and dispatched. In this case, the customer must request a refund or cancellation of the payment either by deposit or bank transfer and/or by credit card, for it to be refunded, as long as it meets the previously explained conditions. The customer agrees that credit card refunds will be for an amount less than the total amount paid on the order since they are subject to a 5% chargeback.

To cancel the purchase order or any of its items, the customer must contact us through the Customer Service Center, via email at [ventas@ergonomicadesk.com](mailto:ventas@ergonomicadesk.com).

**11. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY**

Use of unauthorized or stolen credit cards.

We are not responsible for purchases made with unauthorized or stolen credit cards; it is understood that the person making the purchase is fully authorized to carry out the transaction and, therefore, we cannot refuse to process it. Conducting internet transactions without prior consent of the owner or with stolen cards constitutes fraud, which is punishable by Panamanian law.

Unrecognized payments due to service disagreements or lack of knowledge of the payment method.

We send information via email to our customers regarding our credit card payment providers. We are affiliated with a financial institution with high standards at the regional level, which provides us with secure credit card payment processing, serving as a secure payment agent for our customers with the card-issuing bank. It is informed that the purchase charge will appear on the account statement under the name Ergonomica Desk.

Under no circumstances do we accept any unrecognized payment by the customer due to lack of knowledge of the payment method or disagreements with the delivery. Filing a claim with the bank, thereby denying their purchase, implies potential fraud suspicion; therefore, with the order information, the recipient's signature upon receipt of the order will provide sufficient proof to support the claim. It will then be crucial for the customer to always contact us to clarify any issues.

**12. CONSUMER PROTECTION**

We commit to comply with the Consumer Protection and Defense Law and privacy policy guidelines.

**13. UNFORESEEN CIRCUMSTANCES**

Any situation not foreseen in these policies will be resolved by our Customer Service Center. At all times, compliance with our agreements will be verified under the philosophy of maximum customer satisfaction, understanding that there will be external agents preventing us from fulfilling our purpose.
