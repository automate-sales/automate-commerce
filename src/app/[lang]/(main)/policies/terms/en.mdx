**4.1.** In the event that the User sends information of any kind to ERGONOMICA DESK through the Website, through the channels provided for this purpose on the Website, the User declares, guarantees, and accepts that they have the right to do so freely, that such information does not infringe any intellectual property right, trademark, patent, trade secret, or any other right of third parties, that such information is not confidential and that such information is not harmful to third parties.

4.2. The User acknowledges assuming responsibility and leaving ERGONOMICA DESK harmless

 for any communication they provide personally or on their behalf, with such responsibility extending without restriction to the accuracy, legality, originality, and ownership of the same.

**5. RESPONSIBILITIES AND WARRANTIES**

**5.1.** ERGONOMICA DESK cannot guarantee the reliability, usefulness, or veracity of the services or information provided through the Website. Consequently, ERGONOMICA DESK does not guarantee or take responsibility for: (i) the continuity of the contents of the Website; (ii) the absence of errors in such contents or products; (iii) the absence of viruses and/or other harmful components on the Website or the server that supplies it; (iv) the invulnerability of the Website and/or the impregnability of the security measures adopted therein; (v) the lack of utility or performance of the contents and products of the Website; (vi) the damages or losses caused, to themselves or to a third party, by any person who violates the conditions, rules, and instructions that ERGONOMICA DESK establishes on the Website or through the violation of the security systems of the same.

**5.2.** However, ERGONOMICA DESK declares that it has adopted all necessary measures, within its possibilities and the state of technology, to ensure the functioning of the Website and avoid the existence and transmission of viruses and other harmful components to Users. If the User becomes aware of the existence of any illicit, illegal content, contrary to the law or that could constitute an infringement of intellectual and/or industrial property rights, they must immediately notify ERGONOMICA DESK so that it can proceed to adopt the appropriate measures.

**6. LINKS**

**6.1 Links to other websites**
In the event that from the Website, the User could find links to other websites through various buttons, links, banners, etc., these would be managed by third parties. ERGONOMICA DESK does not have the ability or human or technical means to know, control, or approve all the information, contents, products, or services provided by other websites to which links may be established from the Website. Consequently, ERGONOMICA DESK cannot assume any type of responsibility for any aspect related to the website to which a link may be established from the same, specifically, but not limited to, its operation, access, data, information, files, quality and reliability of its products and services, its own links, and/or any of its contents, in general.

In this sense, if Users become aware of the illegality of activities carried out through these third-party websites, they must immediately notify ERGONOMICA DESK so that it can proceed to disable the access link to them.

The establishment of any type of link from the Website to another third-party website does not imply that there is any type of relationship, collaboration, or dependency between ERGONOMICA DESK and the person responsible for the third-party website.

**6.2 Links on other websites to the Website**
If any User, entity, or website wishes to establish any type of link to the Website, they must adhere to the following stipulations:

- The link may only be directed to the Main Page or Home of the Website, unless expressly authorized in writing by ERGONOMICA DESK.
- The link must be absolute and complete, i.e., it must take the User, with a single click, to the URL of the Website itself and must completely cover the entire extension of the screen of the Main Page of the Website. In no case, unless ERGONOMICA DESK expressly authorizes it in writing, may the website that makes the link reproduce, in any way, the Website, include it as part of its website, or within one of its "frames," or create a "browser" on any of the pages of its website.
- The website establishing the link may not declare in any way that ERGONOMICA DESK has authorized such a link, unless it has expressly done so in writing. If the entity making the link from its website to the ERGONOMICA DESK-owned Website correctly, wishes to include on its website the trademark, name, commercial name, sign, logo, slogan, or any other type of identifying element owned by ERGONOMICA DESK and/or the Website, it must first have express written authorization.
- ERGONOMICA DESK does not authorize the establishment of a link to the Website from websites that contain materials, information, or content that is illegal, degrading, obscene, and generally contrary to morality, public order, or social norms generally accepted. ERGONOMICA DESK does not have the ability or human and technical means to know, control, or approve all the information, contents, products, or services provided by other websites that have established links to the ERGONOMICA DESK-owned Website. In this sense, ERGONOMICA DESK does not assume any type of responsibility for any aspect related to the website establishing that link, specifically, but not limited to, its operation, access, data, information, files, quality and reliability of its products and services, its own links, and/or any of its contents, in general.

**7. DURATION AND MODIFICATION**

**7.1.** ERGONOMICA DESK may modify the terms and conditions stipulated herein, in whole or in part, by publishing any changes in the same manner as these Terms of Use or through any kind of communication directed to Users.

**7.2.** The temporal validity of these Terms of Use coincides, therefore, with the time of their exposure, until they are modified in whole or in part, at which time the modified Terms of Use will become effective.

**7.3.** Regardless of what may be provided in specific conditions that may be established, ERGONOMICA DESK may terminate, suspend, or interrupt, at any time without prior notice, access to the contents of the website, without the User being able to demand any compensation. After such termination, the prohibitions on the use of the contents set forth above in these Terms of Use will continue to apply.

**8. GENERALITIES**

**8.1.** The headings of the different clauses are for information purposes only and do not affect, qualify, or expand the interpretation of the Terms of Use.

**8.2.** In the event that any provision or provisions of these Terms of Use are considered null or unenforceable, in whole or in part, by any court, tribunal, or competent administrative body, such nullity or unenforceability will not affect the other provisions of the Terms of Use.

**8.3.** The failure of ERGONOMICA DESK to exercise or enforce any right or provision contained in these Terms of Use does not constitute a waiver of the same, unless acknowledged and agreed to in writing by ERGONOMICA DESK.

**9. WARRANTY OF CONSUMER GOODS**
In the case of a defective product, the seller must proceed to replace or terminate the contract, which will be free of charge for the consumer and user. The seller is liable for any lack of conformity that becomes apparent within two years of delivery. The consumer and user must inform the seller of the lack of conformity within two months of becoming aware of it. Previously, and since ERGONOMICA DESK is informed about the defective product, it will go through a quality control process to determine whether the defect corresponds to the use of the item or a manufacturing defect.

**10. JURISDICTION**
These General Conditions are governed by the law of the Republic of Panama. The parties submit, at their choice, for the resolution of conflicts and with waiver of any other jurisdiction, to the courts and tribunals of the user's domicile. Likewise, as an entity adhering to THE CONSTITUTION OF THE REPUBLIC OF PANAMA and under the terms of its DATA PROTECTION LAW, in the event of disputes, the user may go to the competent courts within the Republic of Panama.
